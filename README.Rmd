# LIFE101

The goal of the LIFE101 package is to provide a revision resource for our students. The package is based upon the hundreds of multiple choice questions written by our students over time. As this repository grows, this package will continue to add questions to its database.

## Installation

You can install the development version of LIFE101 from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ChrisMitchell42/LIFE101")
```

## How to use this package

Once installed, you should be able to see some options appear in the 'Tutorial' window of RStudio. You can simply select the appropriate tutorial from the list and click 'Start Tutorial'. This will then generate a series of questions for you to answer.

Alternatively, you can select a quiz by running the following code directly in R.

```{r}
learnr::run_tutorial("10 Question Test", "LIFE101")
```
